  - `Question`: Represents a single trivia question with text, image, choices, and correct answer.

- **ViewModels**
  - `GameState`: Manages high score and navigation path using `NavigationStack`.
  - `QuizViewModel`: Handles game logic, question flow, score, and timer.

- **Views**
  - `WelcomeView`, `GameView`, `GameOverView`, `InstructionsView`

- **State Management**
  - Uses `@StateObject`, `@EnvironmentObject`, and `@Published` for reactive data flow.
  - Timer runs via `Timer.scheduledTimer` and stops/resets appropriately.
